# Web-Apps-Frameworks_VFS
Assignments for the Web App Frameworks Class at VFS

## A1 Description
In class we started creating a web project with Vue as the main framework in which a `Landing` and a `About Us` page was created and configured for routing. In the first assigment for the _Web App Frameworks Class_ 2 new screen have to be created: 
- Leaderboard screen
- Contact us screen

## New pages
### Leaderboard screen
In class we have had created a Leaderboard table which now has been moved from the `Landing page` to the `Leaderboard screen`. In addition to this, 2 more components have been created:
- Filter component: This component allows the player to search for players by name
- My Position component: This component allows the player to easily see their current position and how many points they have left before reaching the next position.

### Contact us screen
In this new page a form has been created, providing the necesary space to submit a message with the necesary information, which is name, email and the detail message.

## Run the code
The code need to be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/FernandezDL/Web-Apps-Frameworks_VFS.git). When the code has been downloaded the user has to open 2 `cmd terminals`, one in the `frontend` folder and one in the `backend` folder.

### Commands
If it is the first time running the code it's encouraged to run the `npm install` command.

Once that command has finished you can run both the frontend and backend with the `npm run dev` command. When that command has finished running in the frontend terminal will appear a link to open the project in the web.
